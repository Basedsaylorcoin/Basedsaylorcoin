    <h1>Welcome to Based Saylor Fun (BSLR)</h1>
    <p>Total Supply: 21000000 Based Saylor Fun paired with 0.00004500 Coinbase Wrapped Bitcoin on Base Blockchain</p>
    <p>Until the first 2100 buy transactions are completed no address can hold more than 5000 BSLR tokens. This means that a single address can buy at most 5k tokens during this time. After that the next 210 buy transactions have a limit of 50k BSLR per address. After that no limits apply and BSLR becomes a standard token. Also selling is disabled until 2310 buy transactions pass.</p>
    <p>Contract Address on Base: 0x7c242DA2Cc825b49A143FA030b3A9499804Be291</p>
